- ```best_model.ipynb``` uses the XGBoost model for predictions
- ```app.py``` and ```templates``` folder has the files to run the website
- ```playlist.ipynb``` and ```lyrics-getter.ipynb``` contain the code to get playlist data and lyrics of songs

The model performance and accuracies can be checked by running ```all_models.ipynb```
